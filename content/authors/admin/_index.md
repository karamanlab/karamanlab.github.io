Dr. Ferhat Karaman is an experimental psychologist whose research focuses on the cognitive mechanisms underlying language learning and statistical learning across development.

His work investigates how infants, children, and adults extract structure from linguistic input and how these learning mechanisms support language acquisition. The lab combines behavioral experiments, data-driven approaches, and interdisciplinary methods to better understand how humans learn and process language.

He is currently an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Texas A&M University–Kingsville, where he directs the Karaman Language & Cognition Lab.
